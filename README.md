# sdmx-matrix-generator
Create SDMX-ML markup from DSD Matrix design tool

The Generic SDMX Design Matrix exists as a template from the Checklist for SDMX Design Projects: https://statswiki.unece.org/display/SDMXPM/Checklist+for+SDMX+Design+Projects+Home. It is use to easily visualise SDMX artefacts related to a project without having to know about SDMX technicalities. 

This tool adds the ability to generate SDMX-ML from the Design Matrix so that the SDMX structures can be implemented, stored in registries, etc. It also adds some aspects such as DSD, Constraints, Dataflow, Classifications maintenance.
