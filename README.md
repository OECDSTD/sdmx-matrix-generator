# sdmx-matrix-generator
This tool is used to visually model and design SDMX data artefacts, and generate the SDMX-ML markup for implementation. It is an enhancement of the Generic SDMX Design Matrix. 

The primary goal of the tool is to be able to create the artefacts without a lot of SDMX technical knowledge, and to put the focus on the statistical aspects of the data model.
